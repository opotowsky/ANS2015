\section{Introduction}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Methods and Implementation}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Results and Analysis}
The results were interesting, so interesting in fact that we have decided to
present them here.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Subsection Goes Here}
The user must manually capitalize initial letters of a subsection heading.

For those who like equations in their papers, \LaTeX\ is a good choice. Here is
an equation for the Marshak diffusion boundary condition:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:marshak}
  4 J^- = \phi + 2 D \vec{n} \vd \grad \phi \,.
\end{equation}
If we so choose, we can effortlessly reference the equation later.

Another paragraph starts with Eq.~\eqref{eq:marshak} and sets $J^-$ to zero, a
vacuum boundary condition:
\begin{equation*}
  0 = \phi + \frac{2}{3} \frac{1}{\sigma} \vec{n} \vd \grad \phi \,.
\end{equation*}
The extrapolation distance is $2/3$. A more detailed asymptotic analysis yields
an extrapolation distance of about $0.71045$.

Figure~\ref{fig:voltage} shows how a plot might conceivably look in your
document. Always place figures after they are referenced so as not to throw
off the reader. You can use symbols and different line styles to help
differentiate your results, especially if they are printed in black and white.
Note how Fig.~\ref{fig:voltage} uses dashed lines \verb|--| for the exact
solution, solid lines \verb|-| for the new method's solutions, and dotted lines
\verb|:| for existing inaccurate methods.
\begin{figure}[ht] % replace 't' with 'b' to force it to be on the bottom

  \caption{Captions are flush with the left.}
  \label{fig:voltage}
\end{figure}

Later on, we can include a table, even one that spans two columns such as
Table~\ref{tab:widetable}.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{table*}[htb]
  \centering
\begin{tabular}{llllllllll}\toprule
      & $\phi_T(0)$      & $\phi_T(10)$      & $\phi_T(20)$      &
      $\phi_D(0)$      & $\phi_D(10)$      & $\phi_D(20)$      & $\rho$      &
      $\varepsilon$      & $N_\text{it}$
\\ \midrule
$c=0.999$  & 0.9038 & 20.63 & 31.24 & 0.9087 & 20.63 & 31.23 & 0.2192 & $10^{-7}$ & 15
\\
$c=0.990$  & 0.3675 & 13.04 & 24.7 & 0.3696 & 13.04 & 24.69 & 0.2184 & $10^{-7}$ & 15
\\
$c=0.900$  & 0.009909 & 4.776 & 17.64 & 0.009984 & 4.786 & 17.63 & 0.2118 & $10^{-7}$ & 14
\\
$c=0.500$  & $6.069\times 10^{-5}$ & 2.212 & 15.53 & 6.213$\times 10^{-5}$ & 2.239 & 15.53 & 0.2068 & $10^{-7}$ & 13
\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
  \caption{This is an example of a really wide table which might not normally
  fit in the document.}
  \label{tab:widetable}
\end{table*}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Notice how the table reference uses a Roman numeral
for its numbering scheme, whereas the figure reference uses an Arabic numeral.
For one-column tables, use the \verb|table| environment; two-column tables use
\verb|table*|. The same applies to figures.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Another Subsection}
Excessive sectioning in a three-page document is discouraged, but here are more
subsections to demonstrate compliance with the ANS formatting guidelines.

\subsubsection{Third-level Heading}
This subsubsection shows compliance with the ANS-specified standard. This level
of heading should be used rarely.

\subsubsection{Another Such Heading}
And, if you really think you need a third-level heading, you should make sure
that your subsection needs at least two of them.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Conclusions}

The included ANS style file and this clear example file are a panacea for
the hours of headache that invariably results from formatting a document in
Microsoft Word.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\appendix
\section{Appendix}

Numbering in the appendix is different:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:appendix}
  2 + 2 = 5\,.
\end{equation}
and another equation:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:appendix2}
  a + b = c\,.
\end{equation}
